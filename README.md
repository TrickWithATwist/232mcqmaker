# 232 mcq maker
 Python program I made that opens sample exam pdfs and parses through them to generate practice exams that can be used to prepare for the final mcq exam in CSE 232 at MSU. Instructions are included in this README and in the program itself once you run it in your IDE.

 # HOW TO SET UP AND USE
 You will need to have an IDE that is capable of running python programs in order to use this. I use Visual Studio Code, so the rest of the instructions are going to be written with that in mind. You can also use others like Pycharm but I am not aware of any potential issues that could have.

After you install the progam, you can download the sample exam PDFs from Dr. Nahum's website for 232 (they're not included because it is against the syllabus to distribute course content) and then add them to the
folder that it is in.

As soon as you have the exams you want added, run the code and enter the approriate inputs in the terminal

When you are finished, a file called "mcq.txt" should appear. This will be the exam that is generated.

And that's basically it. My discord's akrdude if you want to connect or give feedback!
